          advisors, and other third parties in connection with the
          consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction
          in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell
          or transfer all or a portion of our assets or business. Should such a
          sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to obligate the
          entity to which we transfer your personal information to use it in a
          manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

        <h3>8. Information Security and Storage</h3>
        <p>
          8.1 We implement physical, technical, and organisational security
          measures designed to safeguard the personal information we process
          through our Services. These measures are aimed at providing on-going
          integrity and confidentiality for your personal information. We
          evaluate and update these measures on a regular basis. However, no
          information system is impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the
          absolute security of your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2 We retain your personal information for as long as we have a
          relationship with you. When deciding how long to keep your personal
          information after our relationship with you has ended, we take into
          account our legal obligations e.g. UK tax legislation requires us to
          hold information for a minimum of 6 years. We may also retain records
          to investigate or defend against potential legal claims. We will also
          retain information on all Tradespeople to help us prevent fraudulent
          activity e.g. trying to open multiple accounts.
        </p>
        <h3>9. International data transfer</h3>
        <p>
          9.1 Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and
          processed in a country that is not regarded as providing the same
          level of protection for personal information as the UK, and may be
          available to the government of those countries under a lawful order
          made in those countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2 We have put in place appropriate safeguards (such as regulator
          approved standard contractual terms) in accordance with applicable
          legal requirements to provide adequate protection for your personal
          information. For more information on the appropriate safeguards in
          place and to obtain a copy of such safeguards, please contact us using
          the contact information set out at clause 2 above.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Your rights over your personal information</h3>
        <p>
          10.1 You may, in certain circumstances, have rights regarding the
          personal information we hold about you. These may include the rights
          to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of, or
          processing of your personal information. You may request to receive a
          portable copy in a usable electronic format of your personal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.2 We encourage you to contact us at the contact information at
          clause 2 above to update or correct your information if it changes or
          if the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate. Where you
          have provided your consent to any use of your personal information,
          you can withdraw this consent at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.3 Please note that we may require additional information from you
          in order to honour your requests. There may be situations in which we
          will not be able to comply with your request due to our regulatory
          obligations to governmental bodies.
